# Sales-Dashboard-using-Tableau
Project Objective :

The objective of this Tableau Sales Dashboard project is to analyse and compare year-over-year (YoY) performance metrics for Current year vs previous year, including total sales, profit, and quantity sold.

The dashboard aims to:

•	Provide a comprehensive overview of sales and profitability across different product subcategories.

•	Highlight key trends and seasonal patterns in sales and profit over months and weeks.

•	Identify top-performing and underperforming segments to support data-driven decision-making.

Questions
1. How have total sales, profit, and quantity has changed of current year as compared to previous year?
2. What were the highest and lowest performing months in terms of sales and profit?
3. Which product subcategories contributed the most to sales and profit?
4. Are there any subcategories incurring losses?
5. What are the weekly trends in sales and profit across 2023?

Dashboard features
- Bans Charts: Monthly comparison of Current year vs Previous year for Sales, Profit, Quantity
- Bar Charts: Sales and Profit by Subcategory
- Highlight Circles: Highest and lowest month indicators
- Filters Panel: Year, Category, Subcategory, Region, State, City
- Weekly Trends View: Sales & profit breakdown by week with average lines

Project process
1.	Data Cleaning: Cleaned and formatted the raw sales dataset in Excel (e.g., removed nulls, standardized date and category fields).
2.	Data Source Setup: Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau, then structured dimensions (e.g., Category, Subcategory, Region) and measures (e.g., Sales, Profit, Quantity).
3.	KPIs & Calculated Fields:
•	% Difference for Sales, Profit, Quantity
•	Calculated fields for identifying highest and lowest performing months
•	Subcategory-level aggregation for performance analysis
4.	Visualizations Created:
•	Line charts to compare monthly trends of 2023 vs 2022
•	Highlight markers for peak and lowest months
•	Dual-axis and synced scale visualizations
•	Bar charts for subcategory-wise sales and profit
•	Weekly trend view with average lines
5.	Dashboard Design:
•	Integrated filters for Year, Category, Subcategory, and Region
•	Added dynamic tooltips, legends, and KPIs
•	Used consistent styling and layout for a clean, professional look

Insights
1.	Sales Growth in 2023:
o	Overall sales in 2023 showed a significant increase compared to 2022, with higher monthly revenue in key months like November and December, indicating strong year-end performance.
2.	Profit Trends vs Sales:
o	While sales grew, profit didn’t increase proportionally—highlighting a potential issue with discounting or rising costs in some subcategories (especially in Technology).
3.	Top-Performing Subcategories:
o	Subcategories like Chairs, Phones, and Binders consistently performed well in both sales and profit.
4.	Underperforming Segments:
o	Certain subcategories (e.g., Tables, Machines) showed low or negative profit margins, suggesting the need for pricing or sourcing strategy adjustments.
5.	Monthly Seasonality:
o	Months like November (Black Friday/holiday sales) and March were strong in both years, while July and August showed dips in both profit and quantity sold.
6.	Weekly Trends:
o	Weekly analysis revealed stable sales patterns, but profit volatility, especially during promotional periods, pointing to potential over-discounting.

Conclusion:

This dashboard effectively visualizes how the business performed across 2023 compared to 2022. 
It highlights:

•	Clear growth in sales, but uneven profitability across subcategories.

•	The importance of seasonal sales planning and inventory optimization.

•	Opportunities to focus on profitable product lines and re-evaluate strategies for low-performing items.

Overall, the insights support data-driven decisions in category management, pricing strategy, and marketing timing to drive both revenue and sustainable profit.
